# Diabetes-prediction-with-XAI
## The diabetes dataset consist of 8 features - Pregnancies,Glucose,Blood_Pressure,Skin_Thickness,Insulin,BMI,Diabetes_Pedigree_Function and Age.
## The data was trained using multiple machine learning models, out of which Random Forest Classifier had the best performance.
## This model is taken and results where visualized using confusion matrix
## Further, Explainable AI techniques like LIME, SHAP and Explainer Dashboard were used to understand the model local and agnostic interpretations.
